# Your Healthy Companion

This project focuses on providing a system which serve as a nutritional assistant for its users. In this application, the users will be able to enter ingredients, recipes, menus so that the users of the system will be able to keep track of the nutrients they get.

This API will allow users to follow the types of nutrients they get, so that it will help them to create a healthy eating plan. While the users can record their diet routine, they will be able to communicate with other users of the system. Therefore, it will be a healthy eating community!
